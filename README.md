### Paper Information

- **Title**: A Decision Support Model for Colorectal Cancer Screening

### Abstract

We present a decision analysis-based approach to provide personalized colorectal cancer (CRC) screening suggestions. Based on an earlier CRC predictive model, we support decisions concerning whether and which screening method to consider and/or whether a colonoscopy should be administered. We include comfort, costs, complications, and information as decision criteria integrated within a multi-attribute utility model. Use cases concerning individual decision support, screening program assessment and design, and screening device benchmarking are presented.
