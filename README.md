# A decision analysis model for colorectal cancer screening
We present a decision analysis-based approach to provide personalized col-
orectal cancer (CRC) screening suggestions. Based on an earlier CRC predictive
model, we support decisions concerning whether and which screening method to
consider and/or whether a colonoscopy should be administered. We include com-
fort, costs, complications, and information as decision criteria integrated within
a multi-attribute utility model. Use cases concerning individual decision support,
screening program assessment and design, and screening device benchmarking are
presented.
